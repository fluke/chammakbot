gcloud compute instances set\-disk\-auto\-delete \fIINSTANCE\fR [\fB\-\-auto\-delete\fR | \fB\-\-no\-auto\-delete\fR] [\fB\-\-device\-name\fR \fIDEVICE_NAME\fR | \fB\-\-disk\fR \fIDISK\fR] [\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR] [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG \&...\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fB$gcloud compute instances set\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR is used to configure the auto\-delete behavior for disks attached to Google Compute Engine virtual machines\&. When auto\-delete is on, the persistent disk is deleted when the instance it is attached to is deleted\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.HP
\fIINSTANCE\fR
.RE
.SH "FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-auto\-delete\fR
.RS 4
Set auto\-delete for the given disk to true\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-device\-name\fR \fIDEVICE_NAME\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a disk to set auto\-delete for by its device name, which is the name that the guest operating system sees\&. The device name is set at the time that the disk is attached to the instance, and need not be the same as the persistent disk name\&. If the disk\(cqs device name is specified, then its persistent disk name must not be specified using the
\fI\-\-disk\fR
flag\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disk\fR \fIDISK\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a disk to set auto\-delete for by its resource name\&. If you specify a disk to set auto\-delete for by persistent disk name, then you must not specify its device name using the
\fI\-\-device\-name\fR
flag\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-auto\-delete\fR
.RS 4
Set auto\-delete for the given disk to false\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR
.RS 4
The zone of the instance to configure disk auto\-delete for\&. If not specified, you will be prompted to select a zone\&.
.sp
To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\fIcompute/zone\fR
property:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A list of zones can be fetched by running:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute zones list
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To unset the property, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"
.sp
Run \fB$ \fR\fBgcloud\fR\fB help\fR for a description of flags available to all commands\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.sp
This command is in the Google Cloud SDK \fBcompute\fR component\&. See installing components if it is not installed\&.
