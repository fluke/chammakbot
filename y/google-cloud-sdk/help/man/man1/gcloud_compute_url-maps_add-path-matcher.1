.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute url\-maps add\-path\-matcher\fR is used to add a path matcher to a URL map\&. A path matcher maps HTTP request paths to backend services\&. Each path matcher must be referenced by at least one host rule\&. This command can create a new host rule through the \fI\-\-new\-hosts\fR flag or it can reconfigure an existing host rule to point to the newly added path matcher using \fI\-\-existing\-host\fR\&. In the latter case, if a path matcher is orphaned as a result of the operation, this command will fail unless \fI\-\-delete\-orphaned\-path\-matcher\fR is provided\&.

If provided and a path matcher is orphaned as a result of this command, the command removes the orphaned path matcher instead of failing\&.

An optional, textual description for the path matcher\&.

An existing host rule to tie the new path matcher to\&. Although host rules can contain more than one host, only a single host is needed to uniquely identify the host rule\&.

If specified, a new host rule with the given hosts is createdand the path matcher is tied to the new host rule\&.

To create a rule for mapping the paths \fI/search\fR and \fI/search/*\fR to the hypothetical \fIsearch\-service\fR and \fI/images/*\fR to the \fIimages\-service\fR under the hosts \fIgoogle\&.com\fR and \fI*\&.google\&.com\fR, run:

Note that a default service must be provided to handle paths for which there is no mapping\&.

This command is in the Google Cloud SDK \fBcompute\fR component\&. See installing components if it is not installed\&.
