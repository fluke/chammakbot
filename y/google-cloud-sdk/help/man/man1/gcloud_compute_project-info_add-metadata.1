gcloud compute project\-info add\-metadata [\fB\-\-metadata\fR \fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,\&...]] [\fB\-\-metadata\-from\-file\fR \fIKEY\fR=\fILOCAL_FILE_PATH\fR,[\fIKEY\fR=\fILOCAL_FILE_PATH\fR,\&...]] [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG \&...\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute project\-info add\-metadata\fR can be used to add or update project\-wide metadata\&. Every instance has access to a metadata server that can be used to query metadata that has been set through this tool\&. Project\-wide metadata entries are visible to all instances\&. To set metadata for individual instances, use \fIgcloud compute instances add\-metadata\fR\&. For information on metadata, see https://cloud\&.google\&.com/compute/docs/metadata\&.
.sp
Only metadata keys that are provided are mutated\&. Existing metadata entries will remain unaffected\&.

In images that have

on them, the following metadata keys have special meanings:
.PP
\fBstartup\-script\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they start running\&. For convenience,
\fI\-\-metadata\-from\-file\fR
can be used to pull the value from a file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstartup\-script\-url\fR
.RS 4
Same as
\fIstartup\-script\fR
except that the script contents are pulled from a publicly\-accessible location on the web\&.

\fB\-\-metadata\-from\-file\fR \fIKEY\fR=\fILOCAL_FILE_PATH\fR,[\fIKEY\fR=\fILOCAL_FILE_PATH\fR,\&...]
.RS 4
Same as
\fI\-\-metadata\fR
except that the value for the entry will be read from a local file\&. This is useful for values that are too large such as
\fIstartup\-script\fR
contents\&.

Run \fB$ \fR\fBgcloud\fR\fB help\fR for a description of flags available to all commands\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.sp
This command is in the Google Cloud SDK \fBcompute\fR component\&. See installing components if it is not installed\&.
