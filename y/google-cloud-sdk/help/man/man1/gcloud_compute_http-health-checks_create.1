.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute http\-health\-checks create\fR is used to create an HTTP health check\&. HTTP health checks monitor instances in a load balancer controlled by a target pool\&. All arguments to the command are optional except for the name of the health check\&. For more information on load balancing, see https://developers\&.google\&.com/compute/docs/load\-balancing/\&.

.HP
\fINAME\fR
.RE
.SH "FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-check\-interval\fR \fICHECK_INTERVAL\fR; default="5s"
.RS 4
How often to perform a health check for an instance\&. For example, specifying
\fI10s\fR
will run the check every 10 seconds\&. Valid units for this flag are
\fIs\fR
for seconds and
\fIm\fR
for minutes\&. The default value is
\fI5s\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-description\fR \fIDESCRIPTION\fR
.RS 4
An optional, textual description for the HTTP health check\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-healthy\-threshold\fR \fIHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR; default="2"
.RS 4
The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy instance is marked as healthy\&. The default is 2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-host\fR \fIHOST\fR
.RS 4
The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check request\&. By default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine automatically sets the host header in health requests to the same external IP address as the forwarding rule associated with the target pool\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-port\fR \fIPORT\fR; default="80"
.RS 4
The TCP port number that this health check monitors\&. The default value is 80\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-request\-path\fR \fIREQUEST_PATH\fR; default="/"
.RS 4
The request path that this health check monitors\&. For example,
\fI/healthcheck\fR\&. The default value is
\fI/\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR \fITIMEOUT\fR; default="5s"
.RS 4
If Google Compute Engine doesn\(cqt receive an HTTP 200 response from the instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health check request is considered a failure\&. For example, specifying
\fI10s\fR
will cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a failure\&. Valid units for this flag are
\fIs\fR
for seconds and
\fIm\fR
for minutes\&. The default value is
\fI5s\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-unhealthy\-threshold\fR \fIUNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR; default="2"
.RS 4
The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy instance is marked as unhealthy\&. The default is 2\&.

This command is in the Google Cloud SDK \fBcompute\fR component\&. See installing components if it is not installed\&.
