.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fB$gcloud compute instances set\-scheduling\fR is used to configure scheduling options for Google Compute Engine virtual machines\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.PP
\fB\-\-maintenance\-policy\fR \fIMAINTENANCE_POLICY\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines undergo maintenance\&. TERMINATE indicates that the instances should be terminated\&. MIGRATE indicates that the instances should be migrated to a new host\&. Choosing MIGRATE will temporarily impact the performance of instances during a migration event\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-restart\-on\-failure\fR
.RS 4
If provided, the instances will not be restarted automatically if they are terminated by the system\&. Mutually exclusive with \-\-restart\-on\-failure\&. This does not affect terminations performed by the user\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-restart\-on\-failure\fR
.RS 4
If provided, the instances will be restarted automatically if they are terminated by the system\&. This flag is mutually exclusive with
\fI\-\-no\-restart\-on\-failure\fR\&. This does not affect terminations performed by the user\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR
.RS 4
The zone of the instance to set scheduling settings for\&. If not specified, you will be prompted to select a zone\&.
.sp
To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\fIcompute/zone\fR
property:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A list of zones can be fetched by running:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute zones list
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To unset the property, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"
.sp
Run \fB$ \fR\fBgcloud\fR\fB help\fR for a description of flags available to all commands\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.sp
This command is in the Google Cloud SDK \fBcompute\fR component\&. See installing components if it is not installed\&.
