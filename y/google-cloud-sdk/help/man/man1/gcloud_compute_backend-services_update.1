.RE
.SH "FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-description\fR \fIDESCRIPTION\fR
.RS 4
An optional, textual description for the backend service\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-http\-health\-checks\fR \fIHTTP_HEALTH_CHECK\fR,[\fIHTTP_HEALTH_CHECK\fR,\&...]
.RS 4
Specifies a list of HTTP health check objects for checking the health of the backend service\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-port\fR \fIPORT\fR
.RS 4
The TCP port to use when connecting to the backend\&. \-\-port is being deprecated in favor of \-\-port\-name\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-port\-name\fR \fIPORT_NAME\fR
.RS 4
The name of a service that has been added to an instance group in this backend\&. Instance group services map a name to a port number which is used by the load balancing service\&. Only one
\fIport\-name\fR
may be added to a backend service, and that name must exist as a service on all instance groups that are a part of this backend service\&. The port number associated with the name may differ between instances\&. If you do not specify this flag, your instance groups must have a service named
\fIhttp\fR
configured\&. See
\fB*\fR\fBgcloud preview instance\-groups add\-service\fR(1)* for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-protocol\fR \fIPROTOCOL\fR
.RS 4
The protocol for incoming requests\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR \fITIMEOUT\fR
.RS 4
The amount of time to wait for a backend to respond to a request before considering the request failed\&. For example, specifying
\fI10s\fR
will give backends 10 seconds to respond to requests\&. Valid units for this flag are
\fIs\fR
for seconds,
\fIm\fR
for minutes, and
\fIh\fR
for hours\&.
