NAME

      gcloud compute instances delete - delete Google Compute Engine virtual
         machine instances

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances delete NAME [NAME ...]
      [--delete-disks {boot,data,all} | --keep-disks {boot,data,all}]
      [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances delete deletes one or more Google Compute Engine
      virtual machine instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME [NAME ...]

         The names of the instances to delete.

FLAGS

      --delete-disks {boot,data,all}

         The types of disks to delete with instance deletion regardless of the
         disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the
         auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly before
         the instance deletion requests are issued. For more information on disk
         auto-deletion, see
         https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/disks#updateautodelete.

      --keep-disks {boot,data,all}

         The types of disks to not delete with instance deletion regardless of
         the disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the
         auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly before
         the instance deletion requests are issued. For more information on disk
         auto-deletion, see
         https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/disks#updateautodelete.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instances to delete. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
