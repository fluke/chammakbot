NAME

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies update - update a target HTTP proxy

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies update NAME
      --url-map URL_MAP [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies update is used to change the URL map of
      existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by one or
      more forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible
      for routing. The target HTTP proxy in turn points to a URL map that
      defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map
      URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

FLAGS

      --url-map URL_MAP

         A reference to a URL map resource that will define the mapping of URLs
         to backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while
         referenced by a target HTTP proxy.

GLOBAL FLAGS
