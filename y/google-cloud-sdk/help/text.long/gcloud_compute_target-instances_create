NAME

      gcloud compute target-instances create - create a target instance for
         handling traffic from a forwarding rule

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-instances create NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
      --instance INSTANCE [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-instances create is used to create a target instance
      for handling traffic from one or more forwarding rules. Target instances
      are ideal for traffic that should be managed by a single source. For more
      information on target instances, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/protocol-forwarding/#targetinstances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target instance.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description of the target instance.

      --instance INSTANCE

         The name of the virtual machine instance that will handle the traffic.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to to create the target instance in. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
