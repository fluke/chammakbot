NAME

      gcloud compute copy-files - copy files to and from Google Compute Engine
         virtual machines

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute copy-files [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC
      ...] [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST [--dry-run] [--plain]
      [--ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE] [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute copy-files copies files between a virtual machine instance
      and your local machine.

      To denote a remote file, prefix the file name with the virtual machine
      instance name (e.g., example-instance:~/FILE). To denote a local file, do
      not add a prefix to the file name (e.g., ~/FILE). For example, to copy a
      remote directory to your local host, run:

        $ gcloud compute copy-files example-instance:~/REMOTE-DIR \
            ~/LOCAL-DIR --zone us-central1-a

      In the above example, ~/REMOTE-DIR from example-instance is copied into
      the ~/LOCAL-DIR directory.

      Conversely, files from your local computer can be copied to a virtual
      machine:

        $ gcloud compute copy-files ~/LOCAL-FILE-1 ~/LOCAL-FILE-2 \
            example-instance:~/REMOTE-DIR --zone us-central1-a

      If a file contains a colon (:), you must specify it by either using an
      absolute path or a path that begins with ./.

      Under the covers, scp(1) is used to facilitate the transfer.

      When the destination is local, all sources must be the same virtual
      machine instance. When the destination is remote, all source must be
      local.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC ...]

         Specifies a source file.

      [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST

         Specifies a destination for the source files.

FLAGS

      --dry-run

         If provided, prints the command that would be run to standard out
         instead of executing it.

      --plain

         Suppresses the automatic addition of ssh(1)/scp(1) flags. This flag is
         useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or re-enable
         strict host checking.

      --ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE

         The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
         ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to copy files to/from. If omitted, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
