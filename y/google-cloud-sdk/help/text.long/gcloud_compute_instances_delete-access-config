NAME

      gcloud compute instances delete-access-config - delete an access
         configuration from a virtual machine network interface

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances delete-access-config NAME
      [--access-config-name ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"]
      [--network-interface NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"] [--zone ZONE]
      [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances delete-access-config is used to delete access
      configurations from network interfaces of Google Compute Engine virtual
      machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the instance from which to delete the access configuration.

FLAGS

      --access-config-name ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"

         Specifies the name of the access configuration to delete. external-nat
         is used as the default if this flag is not provided.

      --network-interface NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"

         Specifies the name of the network interface from which to delete the
         access configuration. If this is not provided, then nic0 is used as the
         default.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to delete an access config from. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
