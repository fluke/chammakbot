NAME

      gcloud compute instances move - move an instance between zones

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances move INSTANCE --destination-zone DESTINATION_ZONE
      [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances move facilitates moving a Google Compute Engine
      virtual machine from one zone to another. Moving a virtual machine may
      incur downtime if the guest OS must be shutdown in order to quiesce disk
      volumes prior to snapshotting.

      For example, running:

         $ gcloud compute instances move example-instance-1 \
            --zone us-central1-b --destination-zone us-central1-f

      will move the instance called example-instance-1, currently running in
      us-central1-b, to us-central1-f.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      INSTANCE

         The name of the instance to move.

FLAGS

      --destination-zone DESTINATION_ZONE

         The zone to move the instance to.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to move. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
