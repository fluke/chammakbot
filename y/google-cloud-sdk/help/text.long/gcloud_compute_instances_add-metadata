NAME

      gcloud compute instances add-metadata - add or update instance metadata

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances add-metadata NAME
      [--metadata KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]]
      [--metadata-from-file KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,...]]
      [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances add-metadata can be used to add or update the
      metadata of a virtual machine instance. Every instance has access to a
      metadata server that can be used to query metadata that has been set
      through this tool. For information on metadata, see
      https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata.

      Only metadata keys that are provided are mutated. Existing metadata
      entries will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the instance whose metadata should be modified.

FLAGS

      --metadata KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]

         Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
         the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
         equals sign. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in
         length. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes in length.
         Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
         key-1=value-1 key-2=value-2 key-3=value-3.

         In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, the
         following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script

            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url

            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

      --metadata-from-file KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,...]

         Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
         from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
         startup-script contents.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to set metadata on. If not specified, you will
         be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
