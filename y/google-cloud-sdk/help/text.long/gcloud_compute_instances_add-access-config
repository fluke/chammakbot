NAME

      gcloud compute instances add-access-config - create a Google Compute
         Engine virtual machine access configuration

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances add-access-config NAME
      [--access-config-name ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"]
      [--address ADDRESS]
      [--network-interface NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"] [--zone ZONE]
      [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances add-access-config is used to create access
      configurations for network interfaces of Google Compute Engine virtual
      machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the instance to add the access configuration to.

FLAGS

      --access-config-name ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"

         Specifies the name of the new access configuration. external-nat is
         used as the default if this flag is not provided.

      --address ADDRESS

         Specifies the external IP address of the new access configuration. If
         this is not specified, then the service will choose an available
         ephemeral IP address. If an explicit IP address is given, then that IP
         address must be reserved by the project and not be in use by another
         resource.

      --network-interface NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"

         Specifies the name of the network interface on which to add the new
         access configuration. If this is not provided, then "nic0" is used as
         the default.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to add an access config to. If not specified,
         you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
