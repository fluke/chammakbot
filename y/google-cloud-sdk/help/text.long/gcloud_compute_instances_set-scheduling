NAME

      gcloud compute instances set-scheduling - set scheduling options for
         Google Compute Engine virtual machines

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances set-scheduling INSTANCE
      [--maintenance-policy MAINTENANCE_POLICY] [--no-restart-on-failure |
       --restart-on-failure] [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      $gcloud compute instances set-scheduling is used to configure scheduling
      options for Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      INSTANCE

         The name of the instance for which to change scheduling options.

FLAGS

      --maintenance-policy MAINTENANCE_POLICY

         Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
         undergo maintenance. TERMINATE indicates that the instances should be
         terminated. MIGRATE indicates that the instances should be migrated to
         a new host. Choosing MIGRATE will temporarily impact the performance of
         instances during a migration event.

      --no-restart-on-failure

         If provided, the instances will not be restarted automatically if they
         are terminated by the system. Mutually exclusive with
         --restart-on-failure. This does not affect terminations performed by
         the user.

      --restart-on-failure

         If provided, the instances will be restarted automatically if they are
         terminated by the system. This flag is mutually exclusive with
         --no-restart-on-failure. This does not affect terminations performed by
         the user.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to set scheduling settings for. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
