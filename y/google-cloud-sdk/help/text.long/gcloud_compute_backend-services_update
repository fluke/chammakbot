DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute backend-services update is used to update backend services.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the backend service to update.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the backend service.

      --http-health-checks HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK,[HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK,...]

         Specifies a list of HTTP health check objects for checking the health
         of the backend service.

      --port PORT

         The TCP port to use when connecting to the backend. --port is being
         deprecated in favor of --port-name.

      --port-name PORT_NAME

         The name of a service that has been added to an instance group in this
         backend. Instance group services map a name to a port number which is
         used by the load balancing service. Only one port-name may be added to
         a backend service, and that name must exist as a service on all
         instance groups that are a part of this backend service. The port
         number associated with the name may differ between instances. If you do
         not specify this flag, your instance groups must have a service named
         http configured. See **gcloud preview instance-groups add-service(1)
         for details.

      --protocol PROTOCOL

         The protocol for incoming requests.

      --timeout TIMEOUT

         The amount of time to wait for a backend to respond to a request before
         considering the request failed. For example, specifying 10s will give
         backends 10 seconds to respond to requests. Valid units for this flag
         are s for seconds, m for minutes, and h for hours.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
