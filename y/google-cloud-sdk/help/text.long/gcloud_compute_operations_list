NAME

      gcloud compute operations list - list Google Compute Engine operations

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute operations list [NAME ...] [--limit LIMIT]
      [--regexp REGEXP, -r REGEXP] [--sort-by SORT_BY] [--uri] [--global |
       --regions [REGION,...] | --zones [ZONE,...]] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute operations list displays all Google Compute Engine
      operations in a project.

      By default, global operations and operations from all regions are listed.
      The results can be narrowed down by providing the --regions or --global
      flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      [NAME ...]

         If provided, show details for the specified names and/or URIs of
         resources.

FLAGS

      --global

         If provided, only global resources are shown.

      --limit LIMIT

         The maximum number of results.

      --regexp REGEXP, -r REGEXP

         A regular expression to filter the names of the results on. Any names
         that do not match the entire regular expression will be filtered out.

      --regions [REGION,...]

         If provided, only regional resources are shown. If arguments are
         provided, only resources from the given regions are shown.

      --sort-by SORT_BY

         A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
         value of this flag with a tilde (~).

      --uri

         If provided, the list command will only print URIs for the resources
         returned. If this flag is not provided, the list command will print a
         human-readable table of useful resource data.

      --zones [ZONE,...]

         If provided, only zonal resources are shown. If arguments are provided,
         only resources from the given zones are shown.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

EXAMPLES

      To list all operations in a project in table form, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list

      To list the URIs of all operations in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list --uri

      To list all operations in zones us-central1-b and europe-west1-d, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list --regions us-central1 europe-west1

      To list all global operations in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list --global

      To list all regional operations in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list --regions

      To list all operations in the us-central1 and europe-west1 regions, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list --regions us-central1 europe-west1
