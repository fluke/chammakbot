NAME

      gcloud compute instances attach-disk - attach a disk to an instance

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances attach-disk INSTANCE [--device-name DEVICE_NAME]
      --disk DISK [--mode MODE; default="rw"] [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances attach-disk is used to attach a disk to an
      instance. For example,

        $ gcloud compute instances attach-disk example-instance \
            --disk DISK --zone us-central1-a

      attaches the disk named 'DISK' to the instance named 'example-instance' in
      zone us-central1-a.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      INSTANCE

         The name of the instance to attach the disk to.

FLAGS

      --device-name DEVICE_NAME

         An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
         system will see. (Note: Device name does not correspond to mounted
         volume name)

      --disk DISK

         The name of the disk to attach to the instance.

      --mode MODE; default="rw"

         Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for read-only
         and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a default. It is an
         error to attach a disk in read-write mode to more than one instance.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to attach a disk to. If not specified, you
         will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
