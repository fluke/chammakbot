DESCRIPTION

      (ALPHA) A table or view reference in the query has the form

          dataset_name/table_or_view_name (for a dataset in the current project)
      or
          /project_name/dataset_name/table_or_view_name

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      SQL_QUERY

         an SQL SELECT statement (typically in the form of a quoted string)

FLAGS

      --allow-large-results

         Enable larger --append-to or --write-to table sizes.

      --append-to APPEND_TO

         Name of a table to which query results will be appended.

      --async

         Create an asynchronous job to perform the query.

      --batch

         Run the query in batch mode.

      --dry-run

         Validate the query, but do not execute it.

      --job-id JOB_ID

         A unique job ID to use for the request.

      --limit LIMIT; default="100"

         How many rows to return in the result.

      --require-cache

         Run the query only if it is already cached.

      --start-row START_ROW

         First row to return in the result.

      --status STATUS; default="periodic"

         Whether the status of the query job should be reported periodically,
         every time the status changes, or not at all.

      --structured

         Preserve nested and repeated fields in the result schema. If not set,
         rows in the result are flattened.

      --use-cache

         Use the query cache to avoid rerunning cached queries.

      --write-to WRITE_TO

         Name of a table to which query results will be written (replacing the
         old contents of the table, if any).

GROUP FLAGS

      --fingerprint-job-id

         Whether to use a job id that is derived from a fingerprint of the job
         configuration.
