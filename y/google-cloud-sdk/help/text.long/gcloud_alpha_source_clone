NAME

      gcloud alpha source clone - clone project git repository in the current
         directory

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud alpha source clone REPOSITORY_NAME [DIRECTORY_NAME] [GLOBAL-FLAG
      ...]

DESCRIPTION

      This command clones git repository for the currently active Google Cloud
      Platform project into specified folder in current directory.

      If you have enabled push-to-deploy in the Cloud Console, this gcloud alpha
      source clone will clone the Google-hosted git repository associated with
      PROJECT. This repository will automatically be connected to Google, and it
      will use the credentials indicated as active by gcloud auth list. Pushing
      to the origin's master branch will trigger an App Engine deployment using
      the contents of that branch.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      REPOSITORY_NAME

         Name of the repository. Note: GCP projects generally have (if created)
         repository named "default"

      [DIRECTORY_NAME]

         Directory name for the cloned repo. Defaults repo name.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

EXAMPLES

      To perform a simple "Hello, world!" App Engine deployment with this
      command, run the following command lines with MYPROJECT replaced by a
      project you own and can use for this experiment.

        $ cd REPOSITORY_NAME
        $ git pull
          https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-helloworld-python
