DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-pools remove-health-checks is used to remove an HTTP
      health check from a target pool. Health checks are used to determine the
      health status of instances in the target pool. For more information on
      health checks and load balancing, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target pool from which to remove the health check.

FLAGS

      --http-health-check HEALTH_CHECK

         Specifies an HTTP health check object to remove from the target pool.

      --region REGION

         The region of the target pool to remove health checks from. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.
