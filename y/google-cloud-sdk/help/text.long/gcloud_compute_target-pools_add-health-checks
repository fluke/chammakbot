NAME

      gcloud compute target-pools add-health-checks - add an HTTP health check
         to a target pool

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-pools add-health-checks NAME
      --http-health-check HEALTH_CHECK [--region REGION] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-pools add-health-checks is used to add an HTTP
      health check to a target pool. Health checks are used to determine the
      health status of instances in the target pool. Only one health check can
      be attached to a target pool, so this command will fail if there as
      already a health check attached to the target pool. For more information
      on health checks and load balancing, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target pool to which to add the health check.

FLAGS

      --http-health-check HEALTH_CHECK

         Specifies an HTTP health check object to add to the target pool.

      --region REGION

         The region of the target pool to add health checks to. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
