NAME

      gcloud compute networks create - create a Google Compute Engine network

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute networks create NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
      [--range RANGE; default="10.240.0.0/16"] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute networks create is used to create virtual networks. A
      network performs the same function that a router does in a home network:
      it describes the network range and gateway IP address, handles
      communication between instances, and serves as a gateway between instances
      and callers outside the network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the network.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the network.

      --range RANGE; default="10.240.0.0/16"

         Specifies the IPv4 address range of this network. The range must be
         specified in CIDR format:
         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing. If
         omitted, 10.240.0.0/16 is used.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
