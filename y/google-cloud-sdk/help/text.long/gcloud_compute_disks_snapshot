NAME

      gcloud compute disks snapshot - snapshot Google Compute Engine persistent
         disks

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute disks snapshot DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
      [--description DESCRIPTION]
      [--snapshot-names SNAPSHOT_NAME,[SNAPSHOT_NAME,...]] [--zone ZONE]
      [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute disks snapshot creates snapshots of persistent disks.
      Snapshots are useful for backing up data or copying a persistent disk.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]

         The names of the disks to snapshot.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the snapshots being created.

      --snapshot-names SNAPSHOT_NAME,[SNAPSHOT_NAME,...]

         Names to assign to the snapshots. Without this option, the name of each
         snapshot will be a random, 16-character hexadecimal number that starts
         with a letter. The values of this option run parallel to the disks
         specified. For example,

           $ gcloud compute disks snapshot my-disk-1 my-disk-2 my-disk-3 \
               --snapshot-name snapshot-1 snapshot-2 snapshot-3

         will result in my-disk-1 being snapshotted as snapshot-1, my-disk-2 as
         snapshot-2, and so on.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the disks to snapshot. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
