NAME

      gcloud compute instances set-disk-auto-delete - set auto-delete behavior
         for disks

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances set-disk-auto-delete INSTANCE [--auto-delete |
       --no-auto-delete] [--device-name DEVICE_NAME | --disk DISK] [--zone ZONE]
      [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      $gcloud compute instances set-disk-auto-delete is used to configure the
      auto-delete behavior for disks attached to Google Compute Engine virtual
      machines. When auto-delete is on, the persistent disk is deleted when the
      instance it is attached to is deleted.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      INSTANCE

         The name of the instance for which to configure disk auto-deletion.

FLAGS

      --auto-delete

         Set auto-delete for the given disk to true.

      --device-name DEVICE_NAME

         Specifies a disk to set auto-delete for by its device name, which is
         the name that the guest operating system sees. The device name is set
         at the time that the disk is attached to the instance, and need not be
         the same as the persistent disk name. If the disk's device name is
         specified, then its persistent disk name must not be specified using
         the --disk flag.

      --disk DISK

         Specifies a disk to set auto-delete for by its resource name. If you
         specify a disk to set auto-delete for by persistent disk name, then you
         must not specify its device name using the --device-name flag.

      --no-auto-delete

         Set auto-delete for the given disk to false.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to configure disk auto-delete for. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
