NAME

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules list - list Google Compute Engine
         forwarding rules

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules list [NAME ...] [--limit LIMIT]
      [--regexp REGEXP, -r REGEXP] [--global | --regions [REGION,...]]
      [--sort-by SORT_BY] [--uri] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules list displays all Google Compute Engine
      forwarding rules in a project.

      By default, global forwarding rules and forwarding rules from all regions
      are listed. The results can be narrowed down by providing the --regions or
      --global flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      [NAME ...]

         If provided, show details for the specified names and/or URIs of
         resources.

FLAGS

      --global

         If provided, only global resources are shown.

      --limit LIMIT

         The maximum number of results.

      --regexp REGEXP, -r REGEXP

         A regular expression to filter the names of the results on. Any names
         that do not match the entire regular expression will be filtered out.

      --regions [REGION,...]

         If provided, only regional resources are shown. If arguments are
         provided, only resources from the given regions are shown.

      --sort-by SORT_BY

         A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
         value of this flag with a tilde (~).

      --uri

         If provided, the list command will only print URIs for the resources
         returned. If this flag is not provided, the list command will print a
         human-readable table of useful resource data.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

EXAMPLES

      To list all forwarding rules in a project in table form, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list

      To list the URIs of all forwarding rules in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --uri

      To list all forwarding rules in zones us-central1-b and europe-west1-d,
      run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --regions us-central1 \
            europe-west1

      To list all global forwarding rules in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --global

      To list all regional forwarding rules in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --regions

      To list all forwarding rules in the us-central1 and europe-west1 regions,
      run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --regions us-central1 \
            europe-west1
