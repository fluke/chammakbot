NAME

      gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output - read output from a
         virtual machine instance's serial port

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output NAME [--port PORT]
      [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output is used to get the output
      from a Google Compute Engine virtual machine's serial port. The serial
      port output from the virtual machine will be printed to standard out. This
      information can be useful for diagnostic purposes.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the instance.

FLAGS

      --port PORT

         Instances can support up to four serial port outputs. By default, this
         command will return the output of the first serial port. Setting this
         flag will return the output of the requested serial port.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to get serial port output for. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
