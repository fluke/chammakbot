POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target pool to which to add the instances.

FLAGS

      --instances INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]

         Specifies a list of instances to add to the target pool.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instances to add to the target pool. If not specified,
         you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
