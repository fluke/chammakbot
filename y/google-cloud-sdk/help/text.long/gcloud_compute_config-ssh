NAME

      gcloud compute config-ssh - populate SSH config files with Host entries
         from each instance

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute config-ssh [--dry-run] [--remove]
      [--ssh-config-file SSH_CONFIG_FILE] [--ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE]
      [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute config-ssh makes SSHing to virtual machine instances easier
      by adding an alias for each instance to the user SSH configuration
      (~/.ssh/config) file.

      In most cases, it is sufficient to run:

        $ gcloud compute config-ssh

      Each instance will be given an alias of the form NAME.ZONE.PROJECT. For
      example, if example-instance resides in us-central1-a, you can SSH to it
      by running:

        $ ssh example-instance.us-central1-a.MY-PROJECT

      On some platforms, the host alias can be tab-completed, making the long
      alias less daunting to type.

      The aliases created interface with SSH-based programs like scp(1), so it
      is possible to use the aliases elsewhere:

        $ scp ~/MY-FILE example-instance.us-central1-a.MY-PROJECT:~

      Whenever instances are added, removed, or their external IP addresses are
      changed, this command should be re-executed to update the configuration.

FLAGS

      --dry-run

         If provided, the proposed changes to the SSH config file are printed to
         standard out and no actual changes are made.

      --remove

         If provided, any changes made to the SSH config file by this tool are
         reverted.

      --ssh-config-file SSH_CONFIG_FILE

         Specifies an alternative per-user SSH configuration file. By default,
         this is ~/.ssh/config.

      --ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE

         The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
         ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
