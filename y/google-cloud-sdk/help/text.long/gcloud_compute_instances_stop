NAME

      gcloud compute instances stop - stop a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances stop NAME [NAME ...] [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG
      ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances stop is used stop a Google Compute Engine virtual
      machine. Stopping a VM performs a clean shutdown, much like invoking the
      shutdown functionality of a workstation or laptop. Stopping an
      SSD-attached VM is not supported and will result in an API error.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME [NAME ...]

         The names of the instances to stop.

FLAGS

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to stop. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
