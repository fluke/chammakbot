NAME

      gcloud compute backend-services get-health - get backend health statuses
         from a backend service

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute backend-services get-health NAME [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute backend-services get-health is used to request the current
      health status of instances in a backend service. Every group in the
      service is checked and the health status of each configured instance is
      printed.

      If a group contains names of instances that don't exist or instances that
      haven't yet been pushed to the load-balancing system, they will not show
      up. Those that are listed as HEALTHY are able to receive load-balanced
      traffic. Those that are marked as UNHEALTHY are either failing the
      configured health-check or not responding to it.

      Since the health checks are performed continuously and in a distributed
      manner, the state returned by this command is the most recent result of a
      vote of several redundant health checks. Backend services that do not have
      a valid global forwarding rule referencing it will not be health checked
      and so will have no health status.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME
