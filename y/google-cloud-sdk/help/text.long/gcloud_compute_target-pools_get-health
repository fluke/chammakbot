DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-pools get-health displays the health of instances in
      a target pool.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target pool.

FLAGS

      --region REGION

         The region of the target pool to get health information for. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
