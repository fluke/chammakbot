      ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances start is used to start a stopped Google Compute
      Engine virtual machine. Only a stopped virtual machine can be started.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME [NAME ...]

         The names of the instances to start.

FLAGS

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to start. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
