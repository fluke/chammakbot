      gcloud compute disks delete - delete Google Compute Engine persistent

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute disks delete NAME [NAME ...] [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG
      ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute disks delete deletes one or more Google Compute Engine
      persistent disks. Disks can be deleted only if they are not being used by
      any virtual machine instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME [NAME ...]

         The resources to delete.

FLAGS

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the resources to delete. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
