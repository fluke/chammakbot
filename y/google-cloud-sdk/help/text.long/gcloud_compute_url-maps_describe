POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

FLAGS

      --region REGION

         The region of the resource to fetch. If not specified, you will be

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.
