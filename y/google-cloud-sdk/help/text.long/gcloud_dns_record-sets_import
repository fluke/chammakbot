NAME

      gcloud dns record-sets import - import record-sets into your managed-zone

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud dns record-sets import RECORDS_FILE [--delete-all-existing]
      [--zone ZONE, -z ZONE] [--zone-file-format] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      This command imports record-sets contained within the specified
      record-sets file into your managed-zone. Note that NS records and the SOA
      NS field are not imported since name-servers are managed by Cloud DNS. By
      default, record-sets cannot be imported if there are any conflicts. A
      conflict exists if an existing record-set has the same name and type as a
      record-set that is being imported. In contrast, if the
      --delete-all-existing flag is used, the imported record-sets will replace
      all the records-sets currently in the managed-zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      RECORDS_FILE

         File from which record-sets should be imported.

FLAGS

      --delete-all-existing

         Indicates that all existing record-sets should be deleted before
         importing the record-sets in the records-file.

      --zone-file-format

         Indicates that the records-file is in the zone file format.

GROUP FLAGS

      --zone ZONE, -z ZONE

         Name of the managed-zone whose record-sets you want to manage.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

EXAMPLES

      To import record-sets from a yaml record-sets file, run:

        $ gcloud dns record-sets import YAML_RECORDS_FILE -z MANAGED_ZONE

      To import record-sets from a zone file, run:

        $ gcloud dns record-sets import ZONE_FILE --zone-file-format \
            -z MANAGED_ZONE

      To replace all the record-sets in your zone with records from a yaml file,
      run:

        $ gcloud dns record-sets import YAML_RECORDS_FILE \
            --delete-all-existing -z MANAGED_ZONE
