POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

         The region of the resources to delete. If not specified, you will be

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.
