NAME

      gcloud compute backend-services remove-backend - remove a backend from a
         backend service

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute backend-services remove-backend NAME [--group GROUP]
      [--zone ZONE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute backend-services remove-backend is used to remove a backend
      from a backend service.

      Before removing a backend, it is a good idea to "drain" the backend first.
      A backend can be drained by setting its capacity scaler to zero through
      'gcloud compute backend-services edit'.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the backend service.

FLAGS

      --group GROUP

         The name of a Compute Engine instance group used by the backend to be
         removed.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance group to remove from the backend service. If
         not specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
