EXAMPLES

      To update an existing deployment with a new config file, run:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config new_config.yaml

      To preview an update to an existing deployment without actually modifying
      the resources, run:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config new_config.yaml --preview

      To apply an update that has been previewed, provide the name of the
      previewed deployment, and no config file:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment

      To specify different create, update, or delete policies, include any
      subset of the following flags;

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config new_config.yaml --create-policy ACQUIRE \
            --update-policy UPDATE --delete-policy ABANDON

      To perform an update without waiting for the operation to complete, run:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config new_config.yaml --async
