SYNOPSIS

      gcloud alpha bigquery jobs wait JOB_ID [--changed-status-only]
      [--fingerprint-job-id] [--ignore-error] [--max-wait MAX_WAIT] [GLOBAL-FLAG
      ...]

DESCRIPTION

      (ALPHA) Waits up to a specified number of seconds for a specified job to
      finish.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      JOB_ID

         The job ID of the specified job. If this argument is omitted and there
         is exactly one running job, that job is used. It is an error if the
         argument is omitted and there is not exactly one running job.

FLAGS

      --changed-status-only

         When reporting the progress of the job being waited for, display only
         changes in status rather than reporting current status periodically.

      --ignore-error

         Do not exit the command with an error if the job finishes in an error
         state. (The default behavior is to exit with an error if the job
         finishes in an error state.)

      --max-wait MAX_WAIT

         The number of seconds after which execution of this command terminates
         even if the specified job has not finished. If not specified, this
         command waits until the specified job finishes.

GROUP FLAGS

      --fingerprint-job-id

         Whether to use a job id that is derived from a fingerprint of the job
         configuration.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.
