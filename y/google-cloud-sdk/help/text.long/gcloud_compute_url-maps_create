NAME

      gcloud compute url-maps create - create a URL map

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute url-maps create NAME --default-service DEFAULT_SERVICE
      [--description DESCRIPTION] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute url-maps create is used to create URL maps which map HTTP
      and HTTPS request URLs to backend services. Mappings are done using a
      longest-match strategy.

      There are two components to a mapping: a host rule and a path matcher. A
      host rule maps one or more hosts to a path matcher. A path matcher maps
      request paths to backend services. For example, a host rule can map the
      hosts *.google.com and google.com to a path matcher called www. The www
      path matcher in turn can map the path /search/* to the search backend
      service and everything else to a default backend service.

      Host rules and patch matchers can be added to the URL map after the map is
      created by using 'gcloud compute url-maps edit' or by using 'gcloud
      compute url-maps add-path-matcher' and 'gcloud compute url-maps
      add-host-rule'.
