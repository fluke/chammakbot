      gcloud compute addresses delete - release reserved IP addresses

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute addresses delete NAME [NAME ...] [--global |
       --region REGION] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute addresses delete releases one or more Google Compute Engine
      IP addresses.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME [NAME ...]

         The names of the addresses to delete.

FLAGS

      --global

         If provided, it is assumed the addresses are global.

      --region REGION

         The region of the address to operate on. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can be fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
