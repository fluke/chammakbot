<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
<dd>
<code>gcloud compute backend-services get-health</code> is used to request the current health status of
instances in a backend service. Every group in the service
is checked and the health status of each configured instance
is printed.</dd>
<dd>If a group contains names of instances that don’t exist or
instances that haven’t yet been pushed to the load-balancing
system, they will not show up. Those that are listed as
<code><var>HEALTHY</var></code> are able to receive load-balanced traffic. Those that
are marked as <code><var>UNHEALTHY</var></code> are either failing the configured
health-check or not responding to it.</dd>
<dd>Since the health checks are performed continuously and in
a distributed manner, the state returned by this command is
the most recent result of a vote of several redundant health
checks. Backend services that do not have a valid global
forwarding rule referencing it will not be health checked and
so will have no health status.</dd>
